# Sign-Up Form
By Jessi B. for The Odin Project

## How to Use this Form
Click for live link! 

This is an HTML & CSS form validation practice project. Front-end form validation skills were the focus,
so there is no Javascript used. On this form, you can enter your first & last name, phone number, and email
address. You can enter a username and password; however, password matching cannot yet be validated (skills 
will be targeted in a later project!).
